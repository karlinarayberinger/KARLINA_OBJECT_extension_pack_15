To Whom It May Concern:

karbytes is in the process of burning three M_DISCs which each have the same data contents burned to them.

Those data contents consist exclusively of the zip files inside of the folder named karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_6_core and the folder named karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_5_setup. (Each one of the three discs will be burned with those two folders (which means that, amongst those three burned discs, there are three copies of each folder)).

The zip file contents of each of the two aforementioned folders are referenced alongside respective data file sizes on the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator on the World Wide Web:

A single unwritten M_DISC has a data storage capacity of approximately 4.7 gigabytes. Hence the aforementioned two folders can both fit on one of those discs (because approximately 3.4 gigabytes of read-only data will be burned to each one of the three discs).

Sincerely,
karbytes
